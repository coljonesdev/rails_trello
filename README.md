# rails-trello

This is a simple clone of Trello made using Ruby on Rails. It was originally a group project we made during Academy Pittsburgh Session 9. The group I was in consisted of @gocothran1, @RHoltje, @Bloombeard and myself. I've been tinkering with it since we finished the class exercise. The original version of the code is located here: https://github.com/gocothran1/rails_trello

Currently working:
* Display Lists and their Cards from a database
* Add new Cards to database
* Cards can be re-ordered within the same List, and that order is saved to the database

Todo:
* Cannot move Cards from one List to another
* Not able to create new Lists yet from the website
