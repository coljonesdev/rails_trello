# rails-trello

This is our attempt to create a Trello clone using Ruby on Rails for the backend.

Currently working:
* Display Lists and their Cards from a database
* Add new Cards to database
* Re-orderable Cards within the same list (no moving to new list yet)

Todo:
* Changes to order of Cards within a List are lost on reload
* Cannot move Cards from one List to another
* Not able to create new Lists yet from the website
